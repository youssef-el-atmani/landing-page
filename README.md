This project is a real mess, in term of the code and commit messages:

I did make no effort into cleaning the code, or write a clean code, I was writing the code in the go,
All what I cared about is that things should look like I expect

The commit messages tell almost nothing, it's no more than:
"Add that part" when writing HTML
And "Style that part" when writing its related Html
